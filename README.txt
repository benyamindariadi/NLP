This model is created to predict the gender of Twitter users based on tweets and profile descriptions. The model uses GloVe pre-trained word vectors and GRU bidirectional architecture. In the notebook made several models with reference to tweets, profile descriptions and both (multi-inputs) to see the comparison of the model's performances.

This data set was used to train a CrowdFlower AI gender predictor. You can read all about the project here. Contributors were asked to simply view a Twitter profile and judge whether the user was a male, a female, or a brand (non-individual). The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a user name, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, and even link and sidebar color.
